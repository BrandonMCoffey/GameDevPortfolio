        <h2>
          Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio!
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a hardworking UT Dallas student and programmer who strives to write
          clean, powerful code and tools for game development. I’m eager to learn and work my skills into solid prototypes and build
          tools alongside the designers who will use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a desire to enter a profession in the games industry because I have a passion for scripting in the sense of building
          tools for designers and to create cool effects and various gameplay mechanics. What I want to do is put my skills and passion
          into a game or idea that someone is passionate about. It might sound a little odd, as typically you hear people wanting to
          create their own dream game, but as it stands my creativity lies in tech demos and complex tools and above all, helping
          someone else create what they love.
        </p>
        <p>
          On another note, I am a third-year university student at the University of Texas at Dallas, studying animation, game development,
          and computer science. I was only introduced to the idea of coding two years ago, and I quickly picked it up by helping my friends
          in their classes and starting and finishing various projects almost every week, one of which was a chess prototype in Processing,
          built with 1.6k lines of code. From there, I decided to take a CS minor and tested out of the first course, and for the next year
          learned C++, Java, Python, C#, HTML, and a little bit of Rust. Now, I love game development and scripting out projects in Unity
          and a couple from scratch. I also have skills in modeling, lighting, and texturing, and am constantly learning every piece of
          software I can get my hands on, from Houdini to Unreal Engine.

          Portal was a fantastic game and followed by the masterpiece that is portal 2, and I wanted to look a little deeper into how it was
          made. The portal itself has multiple approaches involving camera effects, room duplicates, or raycasts, and each has their own ups
          and downs. I decided on camera effects, because they were the easiest to implement in an intuitive way. Each portal has its own second
          camera that renders the scene and passes the ‘image texture’ to the other portal. The effect worked amazingly, after a good amount of
          polish, and I would love to dive into the other methods at some point too.

          A boss battle! With tanks! What could be better? I've long been a fan of an old and simple game called Wii Play Tanks, and wanted to
          implement some of those ideas into a game. The perfect opportunity came as a university project, where we had to build a simple tank
          controller and a boss that could move and attack. I expanded on this idea and built a simple intro cutscene to build up the boss and
          gave him multiple stages to make it more progressive. On a more technical level, I implemented the observer pattern for more efficient
          game references, the state pattern for cleaner AI, and object pooling (for both sound effects and the bullets) for better performance.

          Sound Effects:
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three ways to use a Sound Effect Reference with this tool, either directly input the audio clip, create a Sound Data Object
          (Allows you to adjust volume, pitch, etc. of a clip), or a Sound Event (Can reference multiple clips and select a random volume and pitch
          from specified ranges). The Sound Events allow for unique and interesting sfx during gameplay that vary each time it is played. For
          simplicity, each of these just has to be referenced by a script and can say _soundObject.Play();

          Music Manager:
        </p>
        <p>
          The music manager I am building has layers of complexity and at its core allow for dynamic soundtracks with toggleable levels (Ex: Normal
          and Combat) that can be mixed together. It can fade tracks in and out and allows for different music tracks to be played in different areas
          of the level.

          procedurally, with the use of only two textures, one for scratches and one for the tiles on the floor. This scene was set up and lit in Autodesk
          Maya with the use of Arnold shaders, though the ideas behind procedural shading can be used in Houdini, Unity, or Unreal as well. To further
          this, I am in the process of learning Shader Graph and VFX Graph in Unity HDRP. A breakdown of the wood shader is shown below:

      <h1>The Influence of Earthbound (1995)</h1>

      <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-left-align" style="max-width:1200px;line-height:2">
        <p class="w3-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">
          Earthbound, known as Mother II in Japan, redefined the very popular genre of role-playing games
          (RPGs) with their unique, down to earth, story approach. Development of the game was a joint
          effort between Ape Inc and HAL Laboratories, led by Shigesato Itoi. The developers’ intent with
          this RPG was to get the player invested in a story using emotional storytelling and characters
          with strong and quirky personalities. More specifically, Itoi “wanted to create a game
          (EarthBound) with real characters; characters whom players would recognize in the people
          around them” (Mato). Earthbound achieves these effects on the player through unconventional
          level design, hidden dialog boxes, and personal narrative.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">
          The level design in Earthbound is unconventional and diverse. The world is large with various
          styles for each area while still having minute details. The developers focused on worldbuilding
          more than anything else. This broadens the experience of the game and is more enjoyable across
          different levels. Another key factor is the lack of a hub world. This way, the level feels more
          like an open world, where the player can explore or continue the story as they like. Through all
          the world design and artistic choices, Itoi’s goal is to make the player feel emotions, from
          happiness and satisfaction to loneliness.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">
          At the core of the game, there is the ever-useful text box for dialogue. This common popup is
          manipulated and emphasized purposefully for the context of the moment, giving clearer
          intent. On top of this, clever writing builds and strengthens an emotional
          connection with the player. Around the time Earthbound was released, it was common to see text
          boxes that display information or simple dialog, but Earthbound goes beyond that with quirky
          effects and hidden dialog across the world that makes those who find it feel special. This is an
          interesting choice, as most RPGs are more streamlined and appeal solely to fantasy, while Earthbound
          is surreal and feels like an entirely different genre. Beyond this, there is such an incredible touch
          of personality in the writing, where even simple stuff like saving, battle dialogue, and tips can
          be memorable, ridiculous, or off-putting.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">
          The designers kept the narrative directed and concise, but let it appear open to the player. This
          choice allowed most of the game to be about  all the characters and the towns, rather than the main story,
          The narrative has a quirky and personal appeal, leading
          the player to become more emotionally invested into the story. This was intentional, as Itoi would
          present odd ideas to his team and eventually “people would start chiming in with other similar ideas
          of their own. Those links of reckless wildness are what the Mother games are built on” (Schreier).
          Such a creative open dialogue within the developmental team made Earthbound into a unique and
          intriguing game that became so much more than just a cut and dry RPG. This creative “wildness”
          is directly applied to the narrative and to environmental features.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">
          Earthbound is a unique game that has touched many hearts and inspired many other games. It “remains an
          underappreciated video game franchise with a dedicated cult following, but with it, some of the most
          popular indie games today would not exist” (Jensen). One game that was directly influenced by
          Earthbound is Undertale (2015), by following the unique genre set by Earthbound. The game is about the dialogue
          and world building more than the gameplay itself. These kinds of games are
          an intimate experience for the player, allowing for them to invest in the immersive world presented
          by the non-linear level design and quirky characters.

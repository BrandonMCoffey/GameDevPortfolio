                Welcome to my portfolio!
            </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Brandon Coffey and I am a hardworking UT Dallas student and programmer who strives to write clean, powerful code and tools for game development. Iâ€™m eager to learn and work my skills into solid prototypes and
                build tools alongside the designers who will use them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a desire to enter a profession in the games industry because I have a passion for scripting in the sense of building tools for designers and to create cool effects and various gameplay mechanics. What I want to do is
                put my skills and passion into
                a game or idea that someone is passionate about. It might sound a little odd, as typically you hear people wanting to create their own dream game, but as it stands my creativity lies in tech demos and complex tools and above
                all, helping
                someone else create what they love.
            </p>
            <p>
                On another note, I am a third-year university student at the University of Texas at Dallas, studying animation, game development, and computer science. I was only introduced to the idea of coding two years ago, and I quickly
                picked it up by helping my
                friends in their classes and starting and finishing various projects almost every week, one of which was a chess prototype in Processing, built with 1.6k lines of code. From there, I decided to take a CS minor and tested out
                of the first
                course, and for the next year learned C++, Java, Python, C#, HTML, and a little bit of Rust. Now, I love game development and scripting out projects in Unity and a couple from scratch. I also have skills in modeling,
                lighting, and texturing,
                and am constantly learning every piece of software I can get my hands on, from Houdini to Unreal Engine.

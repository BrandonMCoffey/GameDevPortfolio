            <h2>Portal Recreation Demo</h2>
            <p>
                Portal was a fantastic game and followed by the masterpiece that is
                portal 2, and I wanted to look a little deeper into how it was made.
                The portal itself has multiple approaches involving camera effects,
                room duplicates, or raycasts, and each has their own ups and downs.
                I decided on camera effects, because they were the easiest to
                implement in an intuitive way. Each portal has its own second camera
                that renders the scene and passes the ‘image texture’ to the other
                portal. The effect worked amazingly, after a good amount of polish,
                and I would love to dive into the other methods at some point too.

            <h2>Tank Boss Battle</h2>
            <p>
                A boss battle! With tanks! What could be better? I've long been a
                fan of an old and simple game called Wii Play Tanks, and wanted to
                implement some of those ideas into a game. The perfect opportunity
                came as a university project, where we had to build a simple tank
                controller and a boss that could move and attack. I expanded on this
                idea and built a simple intro cutscene to build up the boss and gave
                him multiple stages to make it more progressive. On a more technical
                level, I implemented the observer pattern for more efficient game
                references, the state pattern for cleaner AI, and object pooling
                (for both sound effects and the bullets) for better performance.

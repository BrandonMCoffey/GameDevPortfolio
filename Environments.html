            <h2>Forest Environment</h2>
            <h4>Unity HDRP</h4>
            <p>
                A lamp-lit forest trail in the late afternoon crossing over a river into a clearing littered with flowers and grass. This was an environment that I created in one month for a class, where everything is modeled and textured
                and lit by myself. Although
                most of what I do involves code, it is useful to know the rest of the pipeline and be capable of doing a first pass on everything from models to gameplay.

            <h2>Old Classroom</h2>
            <h4>Autodesk Maya (Arnold)</h4>
            <p>
                An old classroom that was long abandoned and left to wither and rust. Everything you see in this environment is surfaced and textured procedurally, with the use of only two textures, one for scratches and one for the tiles
                on the floor. This scene was
                set up and lit in Autodesk Maya with the use of Arnold shaders, though the ideas behind procedural shading can be used in Houdini, Unity, or Unreal as well. To further this, I am in the process of learning Shader Graph and
                VFX Graph in
                Unity HDRP. A breakdown of the wood shader is shown to the side:

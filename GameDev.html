            <h2>Telemancer: Septembers Story</h2>
            <h4>Programmer (Unity)</h4>
            <p>
                Telemancer: September's Story is part of a game development course at UTD where 40+ students design and develop a game to completion in one semester. I was in charge of programming Player Systems, which revolves around the the actions that a player can
                take and how they interact with the world. My work included the player's abilities, implementing animations, and setting up feedback and state systems.

            <h2>Tank Boss Battle</h2>
            <p>
                A boss battle! With tanks! What could be better? I've long been a fan of an old and simple game called Wii Play Tanks, and wanted to implement some of those ideas into a game. The perfect opportunity came as a university project, where we had to build
                a simple tank controller and a boss that could move and attack. I expanded on this idea and built a simple intro cutscene to build up the boss and gave him multiple stages to make it more progressive. On a more technical level, I implemented
                the observer pattern for more efficient game references, the state pattern for cleaner AI, and object pooling (for both sound effects and the bullets) for better performance.

            <h2>Portal Recreation Demo</h2>
            <p>
                Portal was a fantastic game and followed by the masterpiece that is portal 2, and I wanted to look a little deeper into how it was made. The portal itself has multiple approaches involving camera effects, room duplicates, or raycasts, and each has their
                own ups and downs. I decided on camera effects, because they were the easiest to implement in an intuitive way. Each portal has its own second camera that renders the scene and passes the ‘image texture’ to the other portal. The effect
                worked amazingly, after a good amount of polish, and I would love to dive into the other methods at some point too.
